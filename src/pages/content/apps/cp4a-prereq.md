Sizing information is also available in the [prerequisites](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCSJL_4.x/install-prerequisites.html)  In addition, beyond the sizing required to support the Cloud Pak, the most important consideration is to appropriately plan for the resources needed to support the application workloads that will be deployed to the cluster.  Sizing for applications varies depending on number of applications, size of application and runtimes.
