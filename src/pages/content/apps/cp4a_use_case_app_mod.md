### Demos
There are several examples of how to run existing applications with the Cloud Pak for Applications.   Most will guide through the process of analyzing an existing WebSphere application, migrating to a Liberty container and deploying on the OpenShift and Cloud Pak.   Listed below are great starting points to showcase this approach:

    - [Application Modernization](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudpak-for-applications/tree/liberty) - Changing cloud runtime to Liberty and deploy on OpenShift
    - [Operational Modernization](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudpak-for-applications/tree/was90) - Maintaining a traditional WebSphere (tWAS) runtime but running within a container on OpenShift
    - [Spring Modernization](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudpak-for-applications/tree/spring)  -- Changing older Spring runtime versions to latest and deploying on OpenShift
