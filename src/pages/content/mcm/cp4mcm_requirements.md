| IBM Cloud Private 3.2 for Linux (x86_64) Cloud Automation Manager 3.2.1 | icp-cam-x86_64-3.2.0.tar.gz | CC2IUEN |


### Minimum Hardware Requirements

**Note:** 
- Ensure the processes, such as Prometheus and logstash, are running and all requirements are met.
- Cloud Automation Manager will consume worker node resources

| Cloud Automation Manager size	| Worker nodes | vCPU	| Memory (GB)	| Notes |
| :---------------------------- | :----------: | :--: | :---------: | :---- |
| Single node deployment | 1	| 12 | >30 | |
| Single node deployment without metering | 1 | 12 | >20 | |
| High availability configuration | 3 | 4 per node | 16 GB per node |	|
| High concurrent deployment requirements (above 10) | 3 | 6 per node | 20 GB per node | 2vCPU 4 GB memory for every additional 10 concurrent deployments |
| Large number of deployed instances | 3 | 5 per node | 16 GB per node | 1vCPU for every 15K deployments managed |

### Persistent Storage Requirements

**Note:** User must create persistent volumes to store Cloud Automation Manager database and log data.

| Persistent Storage | Size (GB) | Recommended | Access | Comments |
| :----------------- | :-------: | :---------: | :----: | :------- |
| cam-mongo-pv       | 20 GB | File Storage  | RWX | 20GB for up to 10k deployments. Add 10 GB for each additional 10k deployments. |
| cam-logs-pv        | 10 GB | File Storage  | RWX | Static |
| cam-terraform-pv   | 15 GB | File Storage  | RWX | Usage can grow or shrink |
| cam-bpd-appdata-pv | 20 GB | File Storage  | RWX | The size grows based on the number of templates in local repository |

### Supported Operating Systems and Platforms

- Cloud Automation Manager performs '**manage-to**' operations directly on the hypervisor and does not have any restriction on the operating system level requirement.
- To know more about minimum system requirements for setting up and running the middleware Content Runtime within a virtual machine, see [System requirements](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS2L37_3.2.1.0/content/cam_content_camc_requirements.html?view=kc).

### Other Requirements

- Internet connectivity is required for deployments to public cloud providers like IBM Cloud, Amazon EC2, and Microsoft Azure.
- | Minimum browser supported |
  | :-----------------------: |
  | Firefox 52 |
  | Chrome 57 |
  | Safari 10.1 |
  | Edge 16 |
- Additional resources and configuration may be required based on the desired use of automation content available with Cloud Automation Manager. To understand the automation content available for use, see [About Cloud Automation Manager Content](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS2L37_3.2.1.0/content/cam_content_overview_summary.html?view=kc).

- Elevated privileges are required. For more information, see [Prerequisites for installing Cloud Automation Manager](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS2L37_3.2.1.0/cam_prereq.html?view=kc).

### Minimum Hardware Requirements

**Note: Demonstration/Proof of Concept**
This is a Size0 environment requirement. This size is suitable for a very small demonstration, trial or proof of concept. It is only suitable for a minimal workload. This size is designed to reduce the size of the microservices deployed to minimize the required hardware.
