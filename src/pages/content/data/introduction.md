## Solution Overview:

IBMÂ® Cloud Pak for Data is a native cloud solution that enables you to put your data to work quickly and efficiently.

Your enterprise has data. Lots of data. You need to use your data to generate meaningful insights that can help you avoid problems and reach your goals.

But your data is useless if you can't trust it or access it. Cloud Pak for Data lets you do both by enabling you to connect to your data (no matter where it lives), govern it, find it, and use it for analysis. Cloud Pak for Data also enables all of your data users to collaborate from a single, unified interface, so your IT department doesn't need to deploy and connect multiple applications.
