## Use case 1

**Order processing**

Integration capabilities for the scenario - APIC + ACE + MQ + Event Streams

![High level overview](assets/img/integration/usecase1/Snip20190917_1.png)

**Scenario**: The company ABC exposes its order processing service as an API. The API is implemented as ACE flow which posts the request to two different systems via MQ queue and ES topic.

### Generate a Secret object for connecting from ACE helm release to the Event Streams instance

  - Navigate to the directory with downloaded artefacts - subdirectory **generateSecret**
  - Copy API Key from previously downloaded **es-api-key.json** to **setdbparms.txt** (Note: copy only key, not the quotes arround it)
  ![API key](assets/img/integration/usecase1/Snip20190917_2.png)
  - Override the text *&lt;API KEY>* in **setdbparms.txt** file.
  ![API key](assets/img/integration/usecase1/Snip20190917_3.png)
  - The result should look similar to the following:
  ![API key](assets/img/integration/usecase1/Snip20190917_4.png)
  - Extract the certificate from the previously downloaded **es-cert.pem** file:
  ```
  openssl x509 -in es-cert.pem -text
  ```
  - Copy the certificate, including the lines `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` and paste it to both files: **truststore-Cert-mykey.crt** and **keystore-mykey.crt**:
  ![Certificate](assets/img/integration/usecase1/Snip20190917_5.png)
  - Navigate to the OpenShift console and select **Copy Login Command**
  ![CLI login](assets/img/integration/usecase1/Snip20190917_7.png)
  - Open terminal window and paste the command
  - Navigate to the **generateSecret** directory and run **generateSecret.sh**:
  ```
  ./generateSecrets.sh my-secret release1
  ```
  - The result should be similar to the following:
  ```
  Creating configuration secret
  kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-file=adminPassword=./adminPassword.txt --from-file=appPassword=./appPassword.txt --from-file=truststorePassword=./truststorePassword.txt --from-file=truststoreCert-=./truststore-Cert-mykey.crt --from-file=serverconf=./serverconf.yaml  --from-file=setdbparms=./setdbparms.txt
  secret/my-secret created
  Creating users secret
  kubectl create secret generic release1-ibm-ace --from-file=adminusers=./adminusers.txt
  secret/release1-ibm-ace created  
  ```

### Configuring MQ artefacts post-deployment

  >Note: The post-deployment configuring of MQ artefacts described here can be used for demo and test environments. For the production we recommend to create a configuration secret to define the MQ configuration as a part of the Helm release or to enable the persistence for the MQ so that the configuration is preserved in case that MQ pods are recreated.     

  - Open Platform Navigator: https://icp-proxy.icp4i-6550a99fb8cff23207ccecc2183787a9-0001.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud/integration

  ![usecase1](assets/img/integration/usecase1/Snip20190911_141.png)
  - Select **System objects: Show**
  ![usecase1](assets/img/integration/usecase1/Snip20190911_142.png)
  - Check the value of SYSTEM.LISTENER.TCP.1 (default is 1414)
  ![usecase1](assets/img/integration/usecase1/Snip20190911_143.png)
  - Navigate to OpenShift console, select **mq** project and the select Application > Services
  ![usecase1](assets/img/integration/usecase1/Snip20190911_144.png)
  - Select the service whose name starts with the queue manager name and has extension '-ibm-mq'
  ![usecase1](assets/img/integration/usecase1/Snip20190911_145.png)
  - Check the NodePort that the listener port is mapped to (in this case it is **32251**):
  ![usecase1](assets/img/integration/usecase1/Snip20190911_146.png)

  - We can access the listener from the outside of the cluster using the cluster proxy host name and this port.
  - However, if we are accessing the mq inside the cluster, we can use &lt;service_name>.svc.cluster.local for the host name and target listener port (not mapped one):
  ![usecase1](assets/img/integration/usecase1/Snip20190911_154.png)

### Modify ACE flow

  - Start the ACE Toolkit and import project interchange file available under the previously downloaded artefacts

  - Select **Http Header** node and configure it to delete header
  ![usecase1](assets/img/integration/usecase1/Snip20190911_152.png)

  - Select **MQ Output** node, for Queue Name specify **NEWORDER.MQ**
  ![usecase1](assets/img/integration/usecase1/Snip20190911_153.png)
  - In the MQ Connect tab define
      - Connection: **MQ client connection properties**
      - Destination queue manager name: **qmtest4**
      - Queue manager host name: **qm-test4-ibm-mq.mq.svc.cluster.local**
      - Listener port number: **1414**
      - Channel name: **ACE.TO.MQ**

  ![usecase1](assets/img/integration/usecase1/Snip20190911_155.png)

  - Select **Kafka producer** node.
  - Enter **NewOrder** for the topic name and previously noted bootstrap server address, in our case it is **icp-proxy.icp4i-6550a99fb8cff23207ccecc2183787a9-0001.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud:32490**
  ![usecase1](assets/img/integration/usecase1/Snip20190911_156.png)

  - The list of artefacts deployed on server appears. In our case we have only the API called **orders**. Click on it:
  ![API](assets/img/integration/usecase1/Snip20190920_37.png)

  - The page that appears shows the **REST API base URL**, link to the **OpenAPI document** (swagger) file, and list of operations. In our case there is only one POST operation and the route of that operation is **/create**:
  ![Operations](assets/img/integration/usecase1/Snip20190920_38.png)

  - Prepare a JSON file with the following content. Name it, for example **order.json**:
  ```json
  {
    "accountid": "A-10000",
    "order": {
      "orderDate": "2004-01-19T04:25:25.938Z",
      "contractId": "00000100",
      "orderDetails": [
        {
          "lineItemNumber": 1,
          "productId": "AJ1-05",
          "quantity": "20"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
  - Navigate to the terminal window and run (note that URL is built from REST API base URL and operation path **/orders**):
  ```
  curl -k -X POST http://orders.icp-proxy.icp4i-6550a99fb8cff23207ccecc2183787a9-0001.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud:30753/orders/v1/create -d @order.json
