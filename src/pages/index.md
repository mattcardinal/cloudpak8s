title: IBM Cloud Paks Playbook
---
IBM Cloud™ Paks are enterprise-ready, containerized software solutions that give clients an open, faster and more secure way to move core business applications to any cloud. Each IBM Cloud Pak™ runs on Red Hat® OpenShift® on IBM Cloud and Red Hat Enterprise Linux and includes containerized IBM middleware and common software services for development and management, on top of a common integration layer. 

This playbook intends to give you step-by-step instructions to install IBM Cloud Paks on Red Hat OpenShift 3.11, for demonstration, Proof of Concept and testing purposes. It is not intended to provide you with instructions for a production-ready environment. 

Each of the Cloud Pak sections contains instructions for installing the Pak on top of Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Services, and in addition how to install each of the Paks in a VMWare environment.
