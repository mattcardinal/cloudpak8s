In on-premises scenarios, we can provision virtual machines in vSphere and install Openshift on top of them in order to get the container orchestration platform necessary to run the cloud paks.\n\nWhen using VMware vSphere, it is recommended to use the [vSphere Storage Provider](https://vmware.github.io/vsphere-storage-for-kubernetes/documentation/) to allow dynamic provisioning of block storage for Cloud Paks.  This should be configured in the inventory file during installation following these instructions: [https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/configuring_vsphere.html](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/configuring_vsphere.html).
