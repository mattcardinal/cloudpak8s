As every Openshift cluster requires servers to host the platform, this forms the base building blocks of the cluster.  As each cloud provider uses a different Terraform provider, the expectation is at the end of these modules we will have a list of IP addresses and hostnames that we can run the Openshift installation across.\n\nSome cloud providers require additional resources outside of just virtual servers; for example on AWS we may require a VPC, subnets, security groups, etc.\n\n| provider | module github |\n|----------|----|\n| vmware   | [terraform-openshift3-infra-vmware](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/terraform-openshift3-infra-vmware) |\n| ibmcloud (classic) | [terraform-openshift-infra-ibmcloud-classic](https://github.com/jkwong888/terraform-openshift-infra-ibmcloud-classic) |\n| ibmcloud (vpc) | [terraform-openshift3-infra-ibmcloud-vpc](https://github.com/jkwong888/terraform-openshift3-infra-ibmcloud-vpc) |\n| azure | [terraform-openshift-azure](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/terraform-openshift3-infra-azure) |\n| aws | |\n| gcp | |\n| openstack | |\n| user provided | [terraform-openshift-userprovidedinfra](https://github.com/ncolon/terraform-openshift-userprovidedinfra) |\n\n### DNS modules\n\nThis category of modules creates records in a Domain Name Service system according to the cluster resources.  It should take as input a list of nodes and hostnames, and any other record types required for cluster execution, and create the records in DNS.\n\nWe also provide a \"hack\" DNS for internal cluster name resolution between all cluster nodes by generating an `/etc/hosts` file and synchronizing it to all cluster nodes.
