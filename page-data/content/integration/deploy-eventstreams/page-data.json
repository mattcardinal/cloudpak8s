Please note this property may have already been updated by other workloads to be higher than the minimum required. Run the following commands on each node:\n\n    ```\n    sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144\n\n    echo \"vm.max_map_count=262144\" | tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\n    ```\n\nYou also may want to consider manually setting security if you run into issues related to permissions.  This applies to non-production/poc type environments where you need to get things up and running quickly.  Here are the commands:\n\n```\noc adm policy add-scc-to-group anyuid system:serviceaccounts:eventstreams\noc adm policy add-scc-to-group ibm-anyuid-scc system:serviceaccounts:eventstreams\n```\nThis assumes you are installing to the eventstreams namespace/project.  If you are using a different location, adjust the last parameter to match your environment.\n\n### Begin Installation  \n1. Go to CP4I Platform Home. Click **Create instance** inside the **Event Streams** tile.  \n1. A window will pop up with a description of the requirements for installing. Click **Continue** to the helm chart deployment configuration.    \n2. Click **Overview** to view the chart information and pre-reqs that were covered in [Prepare Installation](#prepare-installation).\n3. Click **Configure**\n4. Enter the Helm release name. In our example, **es-1**\n5. Enter Target Namespace - **eventstreams**\n6. Select a Cluster - **local-cluster**.\n7. Check the license agreement.  \n8. Under Parameter click **Quick Start** to expand.\n9. Here you will need to set the `Certificate Secret Name`.  Set this to a simple value like `eventstreamssecret`. \n10. Image Pull Secret - Set to `ibm-entitlement-key` if using entitled registry or if offline use the `deployer-dockercfg-XX` secret in your ace namespace.  Use `oc get secrets` to get the exact value for your environment.\n11. Under `External Access Settings` find the `External hostname/IP address` and set that to the icp-proxy address defined during icp / common-services installation - icp-proxy.\\&lt;openshift-router-domain>  \n8. Under Parameters click **All Parameters** to expand. \n9. Under `Global install settings` ensure the `Generate Certificate for Security` checked.\n10. There are other settings you might consider adding, like persistent storage.  It is not required for install but if you wish to add it, the chart will allow for it.\n10. If you do not wish to add persistent storage, you are done.  Scroll to the bottom. Click **Install**.\n\n### Validate Installation  \n1.
